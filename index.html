    <h1 id="">Effects of Stress on the Body</h1>
    
    <p>Wearable technology is rapidly transforming the landscape of personal health monitoring by providing continuous, non-invasive insights into human physiology. The dataset examined in this project, collected using the Empatica E4 wristband, comprises a diverse array of physiological signals—including blood volume pulse (BVP), electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (TEMP), and accelerometer (ACC) readings—captured during carefully structured protocols designed to elicit both acute stress responses and varying intensities of physical exertion (aerobic and anaerobic exercise). Each recording spans several hours and is meticulously annotated with event markers that delineate distinct protocol segments, such as cognitive stress tasks and controlled exercise sessions.</p>
    <p>This dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore how the autonomic nervous system modulates heart rate and other physiological responses in different contexts. By aggregating and analyzing physiological response data across multiple participants, the project aims to uncover characteristic response patterns associated with stress and exercise. Ultimately, this exploratory investigation provides valuable insights that may inform future research in stress detection, exercise physiology, and the development of personalized health monitoring solutions.</p>

  <p>The Blood Pulse Volume (BPV) graph represents a time-series signal derived from photoplethysmography (PPG), a non-invasive optical technique used to measure blood volume changes in microvascular tissue. This signal is captured by wearable devices, such as smartwatches and fitness trackers, and reflects variations in blood circulation with each heartbeat. The data for this graph comes from the Wearable Device Dataset on PhysioNet, which includes physiological measurements recorded from individuals in different conditions.

    The BPV waveform consists of repeating peaks and troughs, corresponding to the systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle. Each peak represents the pulse wave generated by heart contractions, while the downward slope indicates blood returning to baseline as the heart relaxes. The amplitude and shape of these waves provide insight into cardiovascular dynamics, including heart rate variability, autonomic nervous system activity, and vascular health. Factors such as motion artifacts, skin tone, temperature, and device placement can influence the signal quality, making preprocessing and noise reduction important for accurate analysis.
    
    This graph has various applications in health monitoring. It is commonly used for heart rate estimation, as each peak corresponds to a heartbeat. Additionally, BPV analysis supports oxygen saturation (SpO2) estimation, stress and sleep tracking, and cardiovascular health assessment by identifying abnormalities such as irregular heartbeats or poor circulation. By studying BPV data, researchers and healthcare professionals can gain valuable insights into cardiovascular function, stress responses, and overall wellness in a non-invasive manner.</p>
